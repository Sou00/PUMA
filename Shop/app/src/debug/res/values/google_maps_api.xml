    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=CF:84:5F:F5:11:61:75:66:E7:2B:CF:53:EB:3D:FE:C0:67:35:06:9B%3Bpl.edu.uj.shop

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    pl.edu.uj.shop

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    CF:84:5F:F5:11:61:75:66:E7:2B:CF:53:EB:3D:FE:C0:67:35:06:9B

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
